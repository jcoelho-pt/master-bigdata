- **[Avro](http://avro.apache.org/)** is a data serialization system; with Avro we can store and read data easily from different programming languages. It is optimized to minimize the disk space required to store data  
- **[Drill](https://drill.apache.org/)** _Schema-free SQL Query Engine for Hadoop, NoSQL and Cloud Storage_, leverages advanced query compilation and re-compilation techniques to maximize performance without requiring up-front schema knowledge.In a single query you can join data from several storage systems. For example, you can join a collection of user profiles in MongoDB with a directory of event logs in Hadoop  
- **[Impala](https://impala.apache.org/)** open source, native analytic database for Apache Hadoop
