# HADOOP

## Basics of Hadoop and its Ecosystem

### Concepts
**Node:** simply means a virtual or physical machine that can be used for processing and storing. There are two types of nodes in hadoop ```Name``` node and ```Data node```. It is called as a node as all these computers are interconnected. NameNode is also known as the Master node.  

**Rack:** set of 1 to n nodes, which are usually grouped in metal structures with this name that have dimensions established by the industry and located in the same network.  

**Cluster:** is a collection of racks  

**Distributed Systems:** set of physical or virtual machines or nodes physically separated and connected to each other by a communications network; each team has its hardware and software components that the programmer perceives as a single system. Against the provisions of Moore's law, these types of systems are an alternative to server scaling.
