# HADOOP

## BASICS OF HADOOP AND ITS ECOSYSTEM
[Hadoop platform](http://hadoop.apache.org/) is built on Java technologies and capable of processing huge volume of heterogeneous data in a distributed clustered environment. Its scaling capability makes it a perfect fit for distributed computing.  

### CONCEPTS
- **Node:** simply means a virtual or physical machine that can be used for processing and storing. There are two types of nodes in hadoop ```Name``` node and ```Data node```. It is called as a node as all these computers are interconnected. NameNode is also known as the Master node.  
- **Rack:** set of 1 to n nodes, which are usually grouped in metal structures with this name that have dimensions established by the industry and located in the same network.  
- **Cluster:** is a collection of racks  
- **Distributed Systems:** set of physical or virtual machines or nodes physically separated and connected to each other by a communications network; each team has its hardware and software components that the programmer perceives as a single system. Against the provisions of Moore's law, these types of systems are an alternative to server scaling.

### MODULES
- **Hadoop Common:** The common utilities that support the other Hadoop modules.
- **Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS):** A distributed file system that provides high-throughput access to application data.
- **Hadoop YARN:** A framework for job scheduling and cluster resource management.
- **Hadoop MapReduce:** A YARN-based system for parallel processing of large data sets.
- **Hadoop Ozone:** An object store for Hadoop.
- **Hadoop Submarine:** A machine learning engine for Hadoop.
